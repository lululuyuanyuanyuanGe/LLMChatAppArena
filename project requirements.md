There are a lot of different LLM based chat application in the market like chatgpt, claude, gemini, deepseek, qwen, perplexity etc. Most of them are implemented on different models, and different prompt and engineer techniques. Therefore when using different chat apps, sometimes you will get slightly different answer, or answer from different aspect, just like different people think from different perspective for a same thing. Hence when I prompting to LLMs, I like to send the same question to different model and compare the result, I might get more insights then simply relying on the same model/

However mannually copy paste different prompt to different LLM and keep switching different tabs to see the result is very cumbersome and inefficient, also when switching different tabs it is really hard to compares different results, it is way more easier to having all the respones in the same page. Therefore I want to develop an app that will integrate all the LLMs, and layout them in the page, with a single chat box that will simultaneously send user prompts to all the chat app and the result will also be presented on the same page directly. 

How could I implement this app, how could I integrate all the different chat app into the same page, this is the number one issue I need to figure out.
